<h1>Setup Resume.ai locally</h1>

- If you don't already have it installed and want to try it - this was used in the developlent so highly recommend using it for setup as well - install uv for python package management. uv is written in Rust and solved a lot of problems posed by pip, PyPI, conda and the rest. 
- After installing uv run `uv venv my-name` to create your virtual environment
- Next run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
